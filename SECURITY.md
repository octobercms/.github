- Only report issues that fall within the [scope defined below](#scope)

## Scope

We are interested in vulnerabilities that affect October CMS or [first-party October CMS plugins](https://github.com/rainlab), tested on **locally installed software running the latest version**. You can install a local copy of October CMS by following these [installation instructions](https://docs.octobercms.com/setup/installation.html). Please do not test against any October CMS installation you do not own, including [our website](https://octobercms.com).

## Third-party Software

If you find vulnerabilities or attacks resulting from third-party October CMS plugins or themes, they should be reported to the author directly. If the author does not respond, please contact us to escalate the issue. Attacks resulting from third-party libraries should be reported to the library maintainers. Attacks caused by malicious code (malware) should be reported directly to us.
